## slick
A UNIX shell I created in the C programming language. User enters a command, and if it's not a built in command (pwd, cd, etc.), it runs
the command in a child process, before returning to the main shell loop. Future additions to slick include support for auto-resizing buffers,
more signal handlers (interrupt is implemented as of 3/11), and more customizability.
